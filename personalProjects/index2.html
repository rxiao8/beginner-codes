          <p>Hi, my name is Rose X. and I am pursuing a CS degree. I am currently attending a community college, but I hope to transfer to NC State when the time comes.</p>
          <br>
          <p>I am very new to programming and just recently started a college course in Java. I am participating in CTD in hopes of learning a bit more about web development because I wanted to try out both front-end or back-end to which I prefer. Maybe even both. My interests has been peaked by cybersecurity and digital forensics, but since I enjoy visual arts web development has caught my eyes as well.</p>
