Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is used to design the webpage, though not a programming language and more like styling
Inline- used within opening tags and overrides other CSS format
Internal- using <style>CSS selector</style> within the html document
External- linking the html document with a CSS file
	<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="">
----------------
CSS selector{
	key:value;
}
-----------------

selector, declarations, property, value

Google Font Library allows us to import fonts via link
<link href="url" rel="spreadsheet" type="text/css">
The font-family often has backup fonts in case the preferred one does not load ("degrading")
Generic font-family are keywords in CSS
font: style, weight, decoration, transform, 
letter: spacing
word: spacing

use "around words if there are spaces and not underscore dashes"

border: width style color
border-radius with px or %

Color in Css uses hexadecimals, RGB, and HTML color names
	Hexacode use 0-9, A-F to represent a 16 digit system. Colors use the RGB color model where #000000 first two 00 relates to R, the next two for G, and the next two for B
	There are 256 options in the RGB selection

.classNameSelector subElement{}
#idName subElement{}
[attr="value"]{}

Length Unit Options:
	px for pixels
	Absolute lengths-in and mm are fixed measurements
	Relative lengths- em and rem will be based on the the characteristics of the element
	VH-viewport height will adjust the content based on the size of your window

id styles takes precedence over class styles, and all styles will override body styles unless they are inline
In an internal CSS file, the latter style will override any previous relating style since programs read the declarations from top to bottom	(ex: font color was stated pink first, then blue second)

Importing CSS will cause overrides, so if you desire an element to not be changed use !important
	ex: color: teal !important;

Fall back values are essential for older browsers that do not support certain features or for debugging, and is set by listing it after the main value with a comma

Variables exist in CSS and have similar logic to basic OOP:
	--cssVariable: value;
	background-color: var(--cssVariable);
	Using a variable within a selector rule set means the scope is local --> selector {--variable: value;} 
	If you wish to use it globally, you must use the :root selector as it is linked to your html document --> :root{--var: value;}
	An elemental variable has precedence over html variables

Media queries allows specific CSS to be applied based on media types/devices and are breakpoints

Visual Basics with CSS
	text-align will align text for you
	width & height is used with px, em, or percentage based on parental box
	<strong> tag for font-weight: bold;
	<u> tag for text-decoration: underline;
	<em> tag for font-style: italic;
	<s> tag for text-decoration; line-through;

	<hr> for horizontal

	rgba() for color blacks with opacity/transparency control  --> very noice!!

	box-shadow: offset-x, offset-y, blur-radius, spread-radius, color;

	opacity: 0 (transparent) and 1 (opaque)

	text-transform: 5 different types;

	font-weight for thickness
	font-size for text size
	
	line-height for spacing between line text

pseudo-classes are used for selecting the states of the selectors
